## Task Description

The main idea is when the user take a screenshot of any chose by own Application (depends on ```appTitle``` variable at ```KeyInterceptor``` class),
taken screenshot will send to Discord channel (check the ```ChannelId``` field).
Also, you should have to set ```BotToken``` and ```ServerId``` environment variables.

Where can you get the ```BotToken```? Follow the next link:
```https://docs.discordnet.dev/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html```

Take ```ServerId``` and ```ChannelId``` from your Discord.
